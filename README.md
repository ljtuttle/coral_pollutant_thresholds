### Description:
In response to needs identified by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Pacific Islands Regional Office (NOAA PIRO), we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis that explores the effects of various chemical pollutants on corals to identify stressor thresholds. We identified levels of exposure (i.e., concentration) that cause adverse physical, physiological, behavioral, developmental, and ecological responses in coral.
